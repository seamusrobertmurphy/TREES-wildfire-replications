    "section": "0.1 Introduction",
    "text": "0.1 Introduction\n0.1.1 IPCC Tier 1 Overview\nThe IPCC Tier 1 approach for estimating greenhouse gas emissions from fires provides a standardized, globally applicable framework based on readily available data and default emission factors. This methodology applies Equation 2.27 from the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National Greenhouse Gas Inventories (refined in 2019):\n\\[\nL_{fire} = A \\times M_B \\times C_f \\times G_{ef} \\times 10^{-3}\n\\]\nWhere:\n\n\nLfire = greenhouse gas emissions from fire (tonnes of CH₄, N₂O, or CO₂)\n\nA = area burnt (ha)\n\nMB = mass of fuel available for combustion (tonnes ha⁻¹)\n\nCf = combustion factor (dimensionless, proportion of fuel consumed)\n\nGef = emission factor (g kg⁻¹ dry matter burnt)\n\nKey Principles\nThe Tier 1 method prioritizes:\n\n\nConsistency: Uniform application of default parameters enables cross-country comparability\n\nTransparency: Clear documentation of data sources, assumptions, and limitations\n\nCompleteness: Coverage of all managed lands where fires occur\n\nAccuracy: Use of satellite-based activity data with quality filtering (uncertainty &lt; 20%)\n\nConservativeness: Appropriate treatment of CO₂ emissions based on vegetation type and recovery dynamics\nVegetation-Specific Applications\nForest Fires (Humid Tropical Forest and Other Forest): - Only non-CO₂ emissions (CH₄, N₂O) are reported - CO₂ emissions excluded as they are captured in carbon stock change calculations - Applies to fires in Evergreen, Deciduous, and Mixed Forest land cover types\nSavanna Fires (Grassland and woody vegetation): - Non-CO₂ emissions only (CH₄, N₂O) - Assumes CO₂ balance through annual vegetation regrowth - Covers Grassland, Savanna, Woody Savanna, and Shrubland types\nOrganic Soil Fires (Peatland fires): - Reports both CO₂ and CH₄ emissions - Uses IPCC Wetlands Supplement (2014) parameters - Currently validated for Southeast Asia only\nManaged Land Proxy Approach\nThe methodology adopts the Managed Land Proxy (MLP) as the primary framework for attributing anthropogenic emissions. Under MLP:\n\nAll emissions and removals on managed lands approximate anthropogenic effects\nNatural disturbances (e.g., wildfires) are included in total managed land fluxes\nOptional disaggregation separates anthropogenic activities from natural disturbance impacts\nExpectation that emissions from natural disturbances balance with subsequent removals over time\n\nThe 2019 IPCC Refinement provides enhanced guidance for addressing interannual variability (IAV) caused by:\n\nNatural disturbances (wildfires, insects, windthrow, ice storms)\nClimate variability affecting photosynthesis and respiration\n\nVariation in human activities (harvesting, land-use change)\n\nCountries experiencing high IAV from natural disturbances may optionally disaggregate these fluxes to better identify trends in anthropogenic emissions and evaluate mitigation actions.\n0.1.2 FAOSTAT Fires Domain Context\nDatabase Overview\nThe FAOSTAT Emissions from Fires domain provides geospatially-computed estimates of CH₄, N₂O, and CO₂ emissions from biomass burning across all countries and territories. The database:\n\nCovers the complete time series 1990–2024\n\nUpdates annually with new satellite observations\nDisseminates both activity data (hectares burned, tonnes biomass burned) and emission estimates (kt CH₄, N₂O, CO₂)\nProvides regional aggregations for Annex I / non-Annex I country groups\nIntegrates country-reported data from UNFCCC submissions for validation\nMethodological Foundation\nFAOSTAT implements IPCC Tier 1 methodology using:\n\n\nPixel-level processing in Google Earth Engine (GEE)\n\nCountry-level aggregation via FAO Global Administrative Unit Layers (GAUL 2015)\n\nClimate-dependent fuel consumption values stratified by FAO-FRA Global Ecological Zones\n\nQuality-filtered satellite observations (uncertainty &lt; 20%)\n\nThe database serves as an official IPCC-recommended tool for National Greenhouse Gas Inventory (NGHGI) QA/QC processes and validation of activity data and emission estimates (IPCC 2019).\nThree Fire Categories\n1. Forest Fires\nEmissions from fires in Forest Land, disaggregated into: - Humid Tropical Forest: Forest pixels overlaid with FAO-FRA tropical zones - Other Forest: All remaining forest types (boreal, temperate, extra-tropical)\nLand cover identification aggregates MODIS IGBP classes: - Evergreen Needleleaf Forest - Evergreen Broadleaf Forest\n- Deciduous Needleleaf Forest - Deciduous Broadleaf Forest - Mixed Forests\n2. Savanna Fires\nEmissions from Grassland and woody vegetation: - Grassland - Savanna - Woody Savanna - Open Shrubland - Closed Shrubland\n3. Fires in Organic Soils\nEmissions from peat fires identified by overlaying burned area with Histosols class from the Harmonized World Soil Database. Due to high uncertainty and limited validation outside Southeast Asia, emissions are set to zero for all countries except those in Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Brunei Darussalam). Complete global estimates are provided in supplementary files for reference and research purposes.\nUNFCCC Data Integration\nFAOSTAT also disseminates emissions and activity data reported by countries to UNFCCC: - Activity data: Sourced from National GHG Inventories or National Communications - Emission data: Sourced from UNFCCC data portal or Biennial Update Reports (BURs) - Formalized via FAO-UNFCCC Memorandum of Understanding\nThis integration enables direct comparison between: - Top-down satellite-based FAOSTAT estimates - Bottom-up country-reported NGHGI data\n0.1.3 Time Series Data (1990–2024)\nTemporal Gap-Filling\nPrimary Satellite Era (2001–2024)\nDirect observations from MODIS MCD64A1 Collection 6.1 provide monthly burned area at 500m resolution.\nHistorical Period (1990–2000)\nValues backfilled using two approaches: - 1996–2000: Earlier FAOSTAT estimates (Rossi et al., 2016) - 1990–1995: Averaged values from reconstructed time series (1996–2002 mean)\nThis approach ensures complete temporal coverage required for UNFCCC reporting while acknowledging higher uncertainty in pre-MODIS years.\nDisseminated Data Products\nActivity Data: - Burned Area (hectares) by vegetation type and country - Burned Biomass (tonnes dry matter) by vegetation type and country\nEmission Estimates: - CH₄ emissions (kilotonnes) - N₂O emissions (kilotonnes)\n- CO₂ emissions (kilotonnes, for organic soils only)\nSpatial Aggregations: - 203 countries and territories (FAO Tier 1 coverage) - Standard FAOSTAT regional groupings - Annex I / non-Annex I country groups\nQuality Indicators: - Uncertainty metrics (&lt; 20% threshold applied) - Data completeness flags - Gap-filling methodology documentation\nInteroperability and Access\nData Formats: - CSV files for bulk download - Web API for programmatic access - Interactive visualization platform - Google Earth Engine assets for geospatial analysis\nCitation and Licensing: - FAO Open Data Licensing Policy - Standard citation: FAO, 2024. FAOSTAT Climate Change: Agrifood systems emissions, Emissions from Fires, Rome, Italy.\n0.1.4 QA/QC and Validation\nNational GHG Inventories\nPrimary Use: The IPCC explicitly recommends FAOSTAT as a tool for NGHGI QA/QC processes (IPCC 2019). Countries can:\n\n\nCross-validate activity data: Compare satellite-derived burned areas against national fire databases\n\nEvaluate emission factors: Test sensitivity to country-specific vs. default IPCC parameters\n\n\nIdentify data gaps: Detect missing or inconsistent reporting in national systems\n\nAssess trends: Evaluate whether reported trends align with satellite observations\nComparison Frameworks\nTop-Down vs. Bottom-Up Reconciliation:\nFAOSTAT (satellite-based, top-down) ↔︎ NGHGI (ground-based, bottom-up)\nSystematic differences may indicate: - Detection limitations in satellite products (e.g., small fires, smoldering) - Incomplete ground reporting - Different definitions of “managed land” - Biomass consumption parameter uncertainties\nMulti-Source Validation: - Fire Detection: MODIS active fire products (MCD14ML, MYD14) vs. burned area (MCD64A1) - Land Cover: MODIS MCD12Q1 vs. national forest inventories - Emission Factors: IPCC defaults vs. regional measurements from literature\nTier Advancement Pathways\nCountries may use FAOSTAT as a stepping stone to higher-tier methods:\nTier 1 → Tier 2: - Replace default emission factors with country-specific values - Refine fuel consumption parameters using field measurements - Improve combustion factor estimates via burn severity mapping\nTier 2 → Tier 3: - Integrate process-based models (e.g., FOFEM, CONSUME) - Develop national fire monitoring systems - Implement measurement-based carbon stock change assessments\nMitigation Action Tracking\nFAOSTAT time series enable evaluation of: - Prescribed burning programs - Fire suppression effectiveness\n- Land management policy impacts - Climate change effects on fire regimes\nCountries can quantify whether trends in anthropogenic fire emissions diverge from natural disturbance variability, supporting Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) reporting and verification.\n0.1.5 Uncertainty Considerations\nSources of Uncertainty\n1. Activity Data Uncertainty (Burned Area)\nSatellite detection limitations: - Small fires (&lt; 500m): May be missed by MODIS 500m pixels - Canopy-obscured fires: Difficult to detect in dense forests - Smoldering fires: Peat fires may not produce strong thermal signatures - Cloud contamination: Persistent cloud cover reduces observation frequency - Rapid vegetation regrowth: Short time lag between fire and regrowth obscures burn scars\nMCD64A1 applies quality filters: - Only pixels with uncertainty &lt; 20% are included - Commission/omission errors vary by biome - Global burned area may be underestimated by 20-30% (Giglio et al., 2010)\n2. Land Cover Classification Uncertainty\nMODIS MCD12Q1 accuracy: - Overall accuracy: ~75% globally - Confusion between woody savannas and forests - Temporal lag in land-use change detection - Mixed pixels in heterogeneous landscapes\nImpact on emissions: - Misclassification affects fuel consumption values (Table 2.4 ranges: 2.6 to 163.6 t ha⁻¹) - Forest vs. Grassland assignment determines whether CO₂ is reported\n3. Fuel Biomass Consumption Uncertainty\nIPCC default values (Table 2.4) reflect: - High natural variability: Standard errors often 30-50% of mean - Limited empirical data: Some vegetation types have sparse measurements - Climate dependency: Values vary by FAO-FRA Ecological Zones, but within-zone heterogeneity remains\nExample uncertainties (Mean ± SE): - Primary Tropical Forest: 119.6 ± (range: 83.9 to 163.6) t ha⁻¹ - Savanna Woodland: 2.6 ± 0.1 (early dry season) to 4.6 ± 1.5 (late dry season) t ha⁻¹\n4. Combustion Factor Uncertainty\nProportion of fuel consumed (Table 2.6): - Influenced by fire intensity, fuel moisture, weather conditions - Variability within vegetation types: SD often 0.1-0.2 (for factors ranging 0.2-0.9) - Incomplete combustion of coarse woody debris vs. near-complete combustion of grasses\n5. Emission Factor Uncertainty\nIPCC defaults (Table 2.5) based on Andreae & Merlet (2001): - Values represent global averages across fire types - Standard deviations: 20-60% of mean values - Influenced by combustion efficiency (flaming vs. smoldering)\nExample (Savanna fires): - CO₂: 1613 ± 95 g kg⁻¹ - CH₄: 2.3 ± 0.9 g kg⁻¹ - N₂O: 0.21 ± 0.10 g kg⁻¹\nAggregated Uncertainty Estimates\nFor IPCC Tier 1, cumulative uncertainty typically: - Activity data: ±30% for burned area - Emission estimates: ±50% for CH₄ and N₂O, ±30-40% for CO₂\nOrganic soil fires have particularly high uncertainty: - Remote sensing detection challenges - Limited field validation outside Southeast Asia - Difficulty distinguishing surface fires from subsurface peat combustion - Unknown proportion of fires on drained vs. undrained peatlands\nUncertainty Reduction Strategies\nCountry-Specific Improvements: 1. Integrate national fire databases with satellite observations 2. Conduct field campaigns to measure fuel loads and combustion factors 3. Develop regional emission factors from smoke sampling 4. Implement Tier 2/3 methods in high-emission areas\nMethodological Enhancements: 1. Multi-sensor fusion (MODIS + VIIRS + Sentinel) 2. Sub-pixel burned area algorithms 3. Burn severity mapping for combustion factors 4. Seasonal stratification of fuel moisture\nTransparent Reporting: 1. Document all assumptions and parameter choices 2. Report uncertainty ranges alongside emission estimates\n3. Conduct sensitivity analyses for key parameters 4. Compare with independent data sources where available\nTreatment of Interannual Variability\nHigh IAV from natural disturbances complicates trend analysis: - Wildfires can cause 2-3 orders of magnitude annual variation - Obscures anthropogenic emission trends - Challenges mitigation policy evaluation\nOptional Disaggregation Approach (IPCC 2019 Refinement, Section 2.6):\nCountries may separate: - Natural disturbance component: Emissions/removals beyond normal variability (e.g., &gt; 95th percentile) - Anthropogenic component: Remaining managed land fluxes\nThis disaggregation: - Improves clarity of human activity impacts - Maintains MLP total for official reporting - Requires documentation of methods and thresholds - Assumes eventual balance between disturbance emissions and regrowth",
